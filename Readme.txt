Telecom Churn Prediction Project
Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn within the telecom industry, with a specific emphasis on high-value customers. Churn prediction is crucial as retaining existing customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

Business Objective
The primary goals of this project are:

To predict whether a high-value customer will churn in the near future.
To identify the key factors that contribute to customer churn, helping the business to take preventive measures.
Data
The dataset contains customer-level information across four months (June, July, August, and September). The first three months' data are used to predict churn in the fourth month.

Key Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and filtering high-value customers.
Churn Definition: Customers who made no calls and used no data in the ninth month were labeled as churners.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing customer behavior patterns and extracting key insights.
Feature Engineering: Selecting and engineering features that are predictive of churn.
Model Building: Developing classification models to predict churn, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, ROC AUC score, and confusion matrix.
Feature Importance: Identifying the most important features that influence customer churn.
Business Recommendations: Providing actionable insights to reduce churn based on model findings.
Models Used
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Key Findings
Significant differences in usage patterns between churners and non-churners were observed.
The most important predictors of churn were identified and used to make recommendations for customer retention.
Recommendations
Targeted Offers: Provide special offers to high-value customers at risk of churning.
Proactive Engagement: Actively engage with customers who show early signs of dissatisfaction.
Service Quality Improvement: Focus on areas with identified service issues to prevent customer loss.
Conclusion
The churn prediction model can significantly aid telecom companies in retaining their most valuable customers by allowing for timely interventions. Continuous monitoring and model refinement are recommended to enhance predictive accuracy and business impact.
